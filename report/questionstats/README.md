# Question Usage Statistics
In our institution (Federal University of Lavras, Lavras, Brazil - in portuguese, [Universidade Federal de Lavras - UFLA](http://www.ufla.br/portal/), we have an expressive amount of courses in progress (~ 1.7k in just one Moodle instance, called "Campus Virtual"). The sector that coordinates the activities related to the "Campus Virtual" administration is called "[Diretoria de Educação à Distância (DIRED)](http://www.dired.ufla.br/portal/)". A question we have made to ourselves is: "how are all Moodle question types being used by the professors?". 

We believe that the knowledge about the question types usage is important because this may improve the strategies of training and information dissimination about the resources available in Moodle. However, gathering the statistics of question types usage is not a trivial task, mainly when this is performed in a manual way.

Hence, we developed "Question Usage Statistics"; this is a Moodle report plugin that helps the admin to known how the question types are being used by users (e.g. essay, true/false, etc). Feel free to use and contribute to this project by improving the plugin functionality or letting us to know about possible bugs existing in its code.
